# CS3216 Final Project

Group 1 - Coursemology

## Description

Coursemology is an open source gamification platform which makes academic courses more fun and engaging, adding elements found in typical role-playing games to them. Students are given “Missions” instead of assignments, and are rewarded with experience points and achievements for completing them. In addition, participation in discussions with one another is incentivised through rewarding them with additional experience points for insightful or useful posts. Students can also see the progress (or “level”) of their peers, which further motivates them to keep up with their coursework.

Though the gamification elements were complete and working quite well, Coursemology was lacking several features which would be a boon for both teachers and students alike. Though the system allowed assignments to be released and submitted through it, there was no way for teachers to dispense other course materials such as lecture slides. Coursemology also didn’t have an in-built discussion forum; the lack of these components meant that at least two systems had to be used in parallel: Coursemology, and some other service.

Our project focused on adding three components to Coursemology to make up for this deficiency: a discussion forum, lesson plan, and materials bin (or workbin). With these additions, Coursemology no longer requires the use of another service, and can serve as a “self-sufficient” platform for courses that choose to use it.
